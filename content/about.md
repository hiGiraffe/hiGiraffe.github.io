Personal Introduction
---

I am a 4th-year CS undergraduate student at <a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>. I am also an exchange student at <a href="https://www.um.edu.mo/">University of Macau</a>.

Currently I am a research assistant advised by <a href="https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/huanlexu/">Prof. Huanle Xu</a> on LLM inference system optimization and efficient scheduling.Before that, I was advised by <a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1079/2724.htm">Prof. Zhongzhi Luan</a> on performance optimization and parallel computing.

Research Interests
---
My current research interests are broadly in the intersection between systems and machine learning, performance optimization and efficient scheduling of LLM systems for instance. For example, I am very interested in continuing work on research projects like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03243">Llumnix</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09526">LoongServe</a>.At the same time, I am also very fascinated by the challenge of how to handle the deployment of new LLM optimization techniques into the system, such as the work done in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09781">SpecInfer</a>.
