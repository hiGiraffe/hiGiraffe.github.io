I am also an exchange student at University of Macau.\nCurrently I am a research assistant advised by Prof. Huanle Xu on LLM inference system optimization and efficient scheduling.Before that, I was advised by Prof. Zhongzhi Luan on performance optimization and parallel computing.\nResearch Interests My current research interests are broadly in the intersection between systems and machine learning, performance optimization and efficient scheduling of LLM systems for instance. For example, I am very interested in continuing work on research projects like Llumnix and LoongServe.At the same time, I am also very fascinated by the challenge of how to handle the deployment of new LLM optimization techniques into the system, such as the work done in SpecInfer.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Under submission Accelerating LLM Serving with SLO-awareness using CPU and GPU Zizhao Mo, Junlin Chen, Huanle Xu, Shengyong Ding, Yabo Xu, Chengzhong Xu.
